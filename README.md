Ghosts Kitten Adventure
========================

A spooky-but-cute puzzle adventure where two kittens, Frosty and Flurry, try to escape a haunted mansion with the guidance of a mysterious ghost girl.

You dodge ghosts, spikes, and traps across 20 handcrafted levels while collecting keys and finding the exit door.
